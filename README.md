The Travel Route Finder is a Python-based application designed to visually demonstrate how Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to compute the shortest path between cities within a weighted graph. Built with CustomTkinter and Tkinter, the project features an interactive cyberpunk-themed interface where users can enter city names, define distance matrices, and explore paths through a dynamic graph visualization. The system allows users to generate nodes, input distances, and instantly view routes highlighted on a map, along with an animated motorcycle moving along the shortest path for an engaging learning experience. Aimed primarily at students and beginners in algorithms, this tool makes it easier to understand graph theory concepts such as adjacency matrices, weighted edges, and shortest-path computation while providing a clean, modular, and user-friendly GUI environment.
